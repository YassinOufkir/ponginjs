# Pongjs #

A simple pingpong game in js with jquery.

You can play the game [here](https://raptorcloud.net/pongjs/).

Just use your left and right keys.

## Code ##

This game requires jquery to run and a browser that supports javascript (Duh!).

This game can be run locally without a special server or something. (just open index.html)

## Bugs ##

 - Hitsound doesn't play, maybe need some codecs for it?
 - paddle sometimes hit the ball 3 times...
 -
